# challenge-pokemon-php
we were tasked to start coding in php. this reveals alot of surprises both good and "bad".
## the beginning
i'm just trying to display the name and  a picture for now, to get myself familliar.
i found quickly how the fetching worked and how to display as an array in de var_dump. although navigating invoked some confusion at first because addressing different content of that array was different from vanilla js. i found out it is incredably easier then vanilla js. You can just address the name instead of the index of the position of the content of the array.
This way i found the data quickly. also no async await :p.
displaying the data however within html tags required some searching. no i create new domelement but i would like to find a way to talk to already existing html elements.
